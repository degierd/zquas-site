# Engineering Standards



How we build matters as much as what we build.








## Test Coverage



The engine is verified by an automated test suite. Coverage spans cryptographic correctness, GPU compute validation, governance logic, compliance rules, privacy-preserving federation protocols, financial crime detection, synthetic benchmarking, browser-level UI, and infrastructure. The breakdown, counted by each harness's own lister and verified on 12 June 2026: 11,734 GTest, 980 Playwright browser tests, 622 pytest. The shape matters as much as the count: roughly 7 percent are full-scale composition, integration and locked-number proofs at realistic scale, and roughly 93 percent are unit, boundary and single-subsystem correctness tests. A bare count implies more assurance than it delivers, so we publish both. Every test runs on every build. Zero tolerance for failures. Categories include known-answer tests against published cryptographic vectors, cross-validation between independent implementations (GPU vs CPU), boundary value analysis, adversarial input testing, determinism verification across repeated runs, multi-institution federation integration tests with realistic data distributions, and end-to-end browser tests verifying that the operator console renders real data from real detection pipelines.






## FCNS: Falsifiable Detection



The engine includes the Financial Crime Network Simulator (FCNS): a synthetic benchmark that measures AML detection accuracy against realistic criminal behaviour. Eight FATF typologies. Three jurisdiction packs (NL, UK, DE) calibrated against national statistics. Adversarial criminals that adapt when caught. Systemic noise from real banking infrastructure quirks. Macro-economic shocks. 16 formally defined scoring metrics. Every detection claim is testable, reproducible, and falsifiable. No other vendor can prove their detection works. We publish the proof.






## GPU-Native Computation



All detection, scoring, federation, and simulation runs on GPU. Approximately 753,000 source lines excluding third-party code, covering detection, federation, cryptography, simulation, attestation, and adversarial fuzzing. 667 ms median of three runs for a 500,000-entity full detection cycle against the 56-policy catalogue, enforced under a 2-second regression bound in CI. NVIDIA RTX 5090, CUDA 13.1, Linux. Sustained throughput across that cycle is 750,000 complex events per second sustained across a full 500,000-entity detection cycle, where one unit is one entity evaluated against the full policy set and cryptographic attestation generation sits inside the measured path. Zero CPU fallback paths in the detection pipeline. Every kernel is a CUDA global function in a dedicated compute file. Tests call GPU kernels directly with device memory. No CPU wrappers hiding GPU execution. The engine does not use GPU as an accelerator. GPU is the only execution path.






## Privacy-Preserving Federation



Cross-bank detection uses Multi-Party Computation: the data never leaves the bank. Private Set Intersection for identity matching. Arithmetic Secret Sharing and Garbled Circuits for joint risk computation. Oblivious Transfer Extension for efficient protocol execution. The federation protocol runs over the open internet. The security is in the cryptography, not the network. Same elliptic curve foundations as Bitcoin, stronger privacy guarantees. Benchmarked at 100,000 entities per party: a bilateral round completes in 3,052 ms over a loopback development transport, against a 10-second bound enforced in continuous integration. No real-network inter-participant measurement exists.






## Defence-Grade Build



The engine is compiled with memory protection (buffer overflow detection, address space randomisation, data execution prevention), control flow integrity (preventing return-oriented programming attacks), side-channel mitigations (Spectre variant protection), and runtime memory corruption detection. These protections are enabled for every build configuration, not just release builds. The security posture exceeds typical financial services software requirements and aligns with standards expected in critical national infrastructure.






## Reproducible Binaries



Every compilation of the same source code produces a byte-identical binary. No timestamps, no random seeds, no build environment leakage. A regulator or auditor can independently verify that the deployed binary matches the audited source code. Supply-chain integrity is a build property, not an afterthought.






## Maximum Strictness



The codebase compiles at the highest available warning level with warnings treated as errors. Static analysis runs on every build. The engine enforces C++23 standard conformance with no compiler-specific extensions. Build-time contract enforcement ensures that GPU compute kernels and CPU data structures remain aligned. ABI mismatches between components are detected at compile time, not at runtime.






## Proven Cryptography



All cryptographic operations use published, peer-reviewed algorithms. Ed25519 for digital signatures. X25519 for key agreement. Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman for oblivious transfer base operations. Blake3 for hashing with domain separation. No custom cryptography. No proprietary ciphers. Every implementation is validated against known-answer test vectors from the relevant specification documents.






## Exact Arithmetic



Financial computations use fixed-point arithmetic with explicit precision guarantees. No floating-point rounding errors in risk score comparisons or threshold evaluations. GPU compute kernels enforce the same precision constraints as CPU reference implementations, verified by cross-validation tests.
