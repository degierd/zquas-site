        Bounded compliance
on an unbounded platform.




The prototype supports bounded information sharing and signed decision records under the stated trust model.

## CPL



Compliance Policy Language




-
                    DET
                    **Deterministic execution.** Same inputs always produce the same output. No randomness, no environment dependencies, no side effects.


-
                    TERM
                    **Guaranteed termination.** Maximum 10,000 instruction steps per evaluation. The system cannot hang. The system cannot loop indefinitely.


-
                    REC
                    **No recursion.** Policies cannot call themselves. Call depth is statically bounded at compile time.


-
                    SBX
                    **Sandboxed reads.** A policy can only read fields it has declared in its input schema. Access to undeclared fields fails at compile time, not runtime.


- The prototype supports bounded information sharing and signed decision records under the stated trust model.

## ZQUAS Engine



GPU-Native Governance Platform




-
                    GPU
                    **Full GPU compute.** RTX 5090, 32GB VRAM, 170 streaming multiprocessors. No artificial compute ceiling.


- The prototype supports bounded information sharing and signed decision records under the stated trust model.

-
                    SCL
                    **500,000 entities in 3.4 seconds.** Bilateral AML detection at Tier-1 scale. 30 institutions in a single 36-second federation epoch.


-
                    MPC
                    **64 concurrent MPC rounds.** Zero VRAM leaks. Zero memory growth across sustained federation runs.


-
                    TLS
                    **Authenticated encrypted transport.** X25519 key exchange, AES-256-GCM data encryption, Ed25519 peer authentication per session.


-
                    AGT
                    **Agent cognition.** AI-native adaptive monitoring with cryptographic governance at the agent level. Warrants, gas metering, and cryptographic governance at the agent level.




                **The platform computes anything.**

        Why This Matters


## The separation is the product.



Unrestricted compute under restricted policy execution means you get performance without sacrificing provability. Neither property compromises the other.



                FOR REGULATORS


### Verify. Don't trust.



The prototype supports bounded information sharing and signed decision records under the stated trust model.



                FOR BANKS


### Real-time. Not overnight.



The prototype supports bounded information sharing and signed decision records under the stated trust model.



                FOR COMPLIANCE OFFICERS


### No black boxes.



Every ESCALATE and DENY verdict carries a policy ID, the rule that fired, and the threshold that was exceeded. The EU AI Act requires explainability. **ZQUAS provides it by construction**, not by retrofit. The policy set is readable, auditable, and Board Risk Committee-approved before it executes.





    System Stack


## Four layers. Two modes.



The top two layers are bounded. The bottom two are not. The boundary between them is the engine's core design principle.
