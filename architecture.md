# 
        Bounded compliance
on an unbounded platform.




        The compliance layer is deliberately constrained. Deterministic execution. Guaranteed termination. Cryptographic proof for every verdict. The platform it runs on is not constrained at all. That separation is the design.

## CPL



Compliance Policy Language




- 
                    DET
                    **Deterministic execution.** Same inputs always produce the same output. No randomness, no environment dependencies, no side effects.


- 
                    TERM
                    **Guaranteed termination.** Maximum 10,000 instruction steps per evaluation. The system cannot hang. The system cannot loop indefinitely.


- 
                    REC
                    **No recursion.** Policies cannot call themselves. Call depth is statically bounded at compile time.


- 
                    SBX
                    **Sandboxed reads.** A policy can only read fields it has declared in its input schema. Access to undeclared fields fails at compile time, not runtime.


- 
                    ATT
                    **Cryptographically attestable.** Each evaluation produces a cryptographic proof bundle: the policy hash, the inputs read, the verdict produced, and an Ed25519 signature over all three.




                **56-policy logical catalogue. Proofs a supervisor can verify.**

## ZQUAS Engine



GPU-Native Governance Platform




- 
                    GPU
                    **Full GPU compute.** RTX 5090, 32GB VRAM, 170 streaming multiprocessors. No artificial compute ceiling.


- 
                    FED
                    **Real-time federation.** Privacy-preserving cross-bank detection via MPC: ECDH-PSI, garbled circuits, oblivious transfer (OT extension protocol). No raw data shared.


- 
                    SCL
                    **500,000 entities in 3.4 seconds.** Bilateral AML detection at Tier-1 scale. 30 institutions in a single 36-second federation epoch.


- 
                    MPC
                    **64 concurrent MPC rounds.** Zero VRAM leaks. Zero memory growth across sustained federation runs.


- 
                    TLS
                    **Authenticated encrypted transport.** X25519 key exchange, AES-256-GCM data encryption, Ed25519 peer authentication per session.


- 
                    AGT
                    **Agent cognition.** AI-native adaptive monitoring with cryptographic governance at the agent level. Warrants, gas metering, and cryptographic governance at the agent level.

        Why This Matters


## The separation is the product.



Unrestricted compute under restricted policy execution means you get performance without sacrificing provability. Neither property compromises the other.



                FOR REGULATORS


### Verify. Don't trust.



Every compliance decision has a mathematical proof. Not a log file. A cryptographic attestation that the correct policy was applied to the stated inputs. **You can verify any verdict independently**, with a standalone CLI tool, without relying on the running production engine or its internal state. The verifier is written by ZQUAS and currently links the CUDA runtime; a CPU-only verifier is planned.



                FOR BANKS


### Real-time. Not overnight.



Compliance policies execute on GPU in parallel, not in sequential overnight batch cycles. Cross-bank money laundering detection that TMNL took 24 hours to attempt takes ZQUAS **36 seconds with zero data shared** across institutions.



                FOR COMPLIANCE OFFICERS


### No black boxes.



Every ESCALATE and DENY verdict carries a policy ID, the rule that fired, and the threshold that was exceeded. The EU AI Act requires explainability. **ZQUAS provides it by construction**, not by retrofit. The policy set is readable, auditable, and Board Risk Committee-approved before it executes.





    System Stack


## Four layers. Two modes.



The top two layers are bounded. The bottom two are not. The boundary between them is the engine's core design principle.
