Founding Partner Programme


# Three institutions.
Three pilot slots.
One question answered.



Can cross-institutional AML detection work with no raw or directly identifying customer data leaving the institution? We have built the platform. Now we need three banks to prove it under regulatory supervision.




                Slot 1 — Available



                Slot 2 — Available



                Slot 3 — Available

## The Opportunity



            The EU Anti-Money Laundering Regulation takes effect on 10 July 2027. For the first time, Article 75 creates a legal framework for cross-institutional AML information sharing. Every bank in Europe is evaluating how to comply.




            ZQUAS has built a platform for cross-institutional AML detection in which no raw or directly identifying customer data leaves the institution. Using Multi-Party Computation, banks jointly identify cross-bank laundering patterns while each institution's data remains within its own infrastructure. No data extraction. No central database. The status of MPC protocol messages under EU data protection law has not been ruled on by any authority, and obtaining a formal assessment from a national data protection authority is a stated objective of the programme.




            Readiness is TRL 6: an integrated prototype demonstrated in a controlled relevant environment, validated on synthetic data, with no production deployments. A 56-policy logical catalogue, pinned by static assertion to the catalogue array, with a 128-policy corpus (34 fail-closed screening, 94 detection) used for scale characterisation. GPU-native. Real-time. Cryptographically attestable. The Founding Partner Programme is how three institutions join first.

                Published on both parties' websites. Submitted to ACAMS, BAFT, and Sibos. A published credential for the compliance team: the MLRO can present it at industry events and reference it in regulatory submissions.


                Benefit 05
                Dedicated Integration Engineer
                One ZQUAS engineer assigned to the bank for the full pilot duration. Handles deployment, data feed configuration, and results compilation. Part-time from the bank: one IT contact, one compliance contact.


                Benefit 06
                Data Sovereignty Guarantee
                Contractually guaranteed: no customer data leaves the bank's infrastructure at any point. Not a policy. A property of the cryptographic protocol. Independently verifiable by technical audit.

## The Pilot



            The pilot validates one capability: cross-institutional AML detection using MPC federation, with real compliance policies, against realistic data, under regulatory observation.




### Scope






| 
                        Dimension | 
                        Detail 
| 
                        Entities | 
                        Minimum 5,000 per institution, up to 500,000. Synthetic data with planted typologies, or representative data from the bank's existing monitoring system. 
| 
                        Policies | 
                        The 56-policy logical catalogue, adapted to each institution's regulatory perimeter if needed. 
| 
                        Federation | 
                        Direct peer-to-peer MPC rounds between all Founding Partners. End-to-end encrypted (AES-256-GCM), authenticated (Ed25519), with cryptographic attestation on every verdict. 
| 
                        Detection targets | 
                        Correspondent banking wire stripping, validated end to end as a named cohort on synthetic data across simulated participants. Trade-based over-invoicing, shell company layering and funnel account structuring are designed and in scope, not validated. Plus a legitimate control population. Measured outputs: detection rate, false positive rate, federation time. 
### Timeline: 12 weeks from signature to results



                Weeks 1–2

                    **Onboarding**


Legal agreements signed. ZQUAS installation deployed. Data feed configured. Integration engineer assigned on-site or remote.




                Weeks 3–4

                    **Validation**


Single-institution policy evaluation. Verify the policy catalogue produces correct results against the bank's entity data. Calibrate thresholds to the bank's risk appetite.




                Weeks 5–8

                    **Federation**


Cross-institutional MPC rounds between Founding Partners. Bilateral detection. Measure results. Resolve any integration issues.




                Weeks 9–10

                    **Results**


Compile detection results. Benchmark report. Case study draft. Regulatory sandbox submission prepared.




                Weeks 11–12

                    **Sandbox**


Joint presentation to regulator. Demonstrate detection. Discuss GDPR position on MPC protocol messages. Obtain regulatory feedback.







### What the bank needs to provide






| 
                        Requirement | 
                        Detail 
| 
                        Entity risk data | 
                        Entity identifier plus risk score per entity. Synthetic or representative. No raw transaction data required. 
| 
                        Infrastructure | 
                        One server or VM with an NVIDIA GPU. ZQUAS is GPU-first: CPU execution paths have been progressively removed and there is no CPU fallback in the detection hot path. Any residual CPU path is compile-time marked, non-default and logged at runtime, so GPU failure fails loudly rather than silently degrading. One outbound TCP connection to peer banks. 
| 
                        People | 
                        One IT contact for deployment. One compliance contact for policy calibration and results review. Part-time commitment, not full-time. 
| 
                        Regulatory relationship | 
                        Willingness to participate in a joint sandbox submission to the relevant regulator (DNB, FCA, or national FSA). 
| 
                        Legal | 
                        Standard NDA plus pilot agreement. ZQUAS provides templates. Typical legal review: 2 to 4 weeks. No procurement RFP required.

## Why Now



            AMLR applies directly from 10 July 2027. Unlike previous directives, there is no national transposition period. The regulation is directly applicable in all EU member states from that date. AMLA begins direct supervision of high-risk cross-border institutions in 2028.




            Banks that can demonstrate cross-institutional detection capability before July 2027 are ahead of the compliance curve. Banks that cannot will be responding to regulatory requests after the deadline.




            Cross-institutional detection is a network. It becomes more valuable with each institution that joins. The first three banks to deploy MPC federation establish the network. Every subsequent bank that joins benefits from the detection capability the founders built. Founding Partners are not just early customers. They are the initial participants in a network that will ultimately span the entire banking sector.




            The window in which Founding Partners can shape the platform, the policies, and the market is measured in months, not years.

## About ZQUAS



            ZQUAS is a GPU-native governance and financial crime compliance platform. The core engine executes deterministic compliance policies in real time on GPU, producing cryptographically attestable decisions for each verdict. Each decision produces a cryptographic proof bundle: a record of the policy that fired, the inputs it read, and the verdict it produced. A regulator can verify this independently, years after the fact.




            The federation layer enables privacy-preserving cross-institutional detection using Multi-Party Computation: ECDH-PSI for entity matching, Yao's Garbled Circuits for risk comparison, and Oblivious Transfer for secure key exchange. Banks detect cross-bank laundering patterns without any institution accessing any other institution's data.
