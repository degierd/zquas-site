# A Different Architecture



            Most compliance platforms add AI to existing software. We built a governance engine where AI is the foundation.







                2000s Architecture


### Traditional



Rule-based engines built in the 2000s. Process transactions in batches. Flag based on static thresholds. Manual investigation.



                Bolt-on AI


### AI-Augmented



Machine learning models added to existing platforms. Better pattern detection, but the same batch architecture underneath. AI assists humans.



                ZQUAS


### AI-Native



Built from the ground up as a GPU-native runtime. Each monitored entity carries its own state, risk profile, and decision history, and is evaluated against the policy set on every change. AI sits inside the same governance perimeter as the rules engine, not bolted on after the fact. Decisions are computed, verified, and signed at GPU speed.

                        Traditional | 
                        AI-Augmented | 
                        ZQUAS 
| 
                        Architecture | 
                        Database and rules engine. SQL queries on stored transactions. | 
                        Database with ML models. Batch scoring added to existing pipeline. | 
                        GPU-native entity system. Each monitored account carries its own state, risk profile, and decision history, evaluated against the policy set on every change. 750,000 complex events per second sustained across a full 500,000-entity detection cycle, where one unit is one entity evaluated against the full policy set and cryptographic attestation generation sits inside the measured path. 
| 
                        AI Integration | 
                        None. Rules are manually authored and maintained. | 
                        ML models flag transactions for human review. Models are trained offline, deployed as scoring services. | 
                        AI is the runtime. Every entity operates as an agent that perceives, evaluates, and acts within a governed framework. Agents propose actions. A governance validation layer verifies every proposal against certified rules before execution. 
| 
                        Cross-Institutional Detection | 
                        Not possible. Each institution operates in isolation. | 
                        Not possible. Same data silo, better algorithms. | 
                        Privacy-preserving federation: ECDH-PSI + Garbled Circuits + OT. Banks jointly detect suspicious entities without sharing data. 3,052 ms per bilateral round at 100K entities per party, over a loopback development transport. Dual Ed25519 attestation per round. 
| 
                        Processing Speed | 
                        Batch. Overnight or hourly. Thousands of decisions per second. | 
                        Near-real-time. Minutes to hours. Tens of thousands per second. | 
                        667 ms median of three runs for a 500,000-entity full detection cycle against the 56-policy catalogue, enforced under a 2-second regression bound in CI. NVIDIA RTX 5090, CUDA 13.1, Linux. Sustained throughput across that cycle is 750,000 complex events per second sustained across a full 500,000-entity detection cycle, where one unit is one entity evaluated against the full policy set and cryptographic attestation generation sits inside the measured path. 
| 
                        Governance Model | 
                        Configuration files. Change management committees. Months to update a rule. | 
                        Model governance. Bias testing, validation reports. Weeks to retrain and deploy. | 
                        Three-layer governance. Layer 1: formally verified execution core (immutable at runtime). Layer 2: certified rule schemas (versioned, validated). Layer 3: AI-generated content (every decision audited with reasoning). A governance validation layer sits between the rules and the AI, rejecting any proposal that violates the certified schema. 
| 
                        Audit Trail | 
                        Log files. Database records. Manually reviewed during examinations. | 
                        Log files plus model cards. Feature importance scores. | 
                        Cryptographic audit ledger. Every governance decision is recorded in a tamper-proof, cryptographically chained log. Ed25519 signatures. Blake3 integrity hashing. The audit trail is mathematically verifiable, not just reviewable. 
| 
                        Explainability | 
                        Rule X matched. Human analyst explains the context. | 
                        SHAP values. Feature importance. Partial dependence plots. Requires data science expertise to interpret. | 
                        Glass Box. Every decision carries a structured explanation of why it was made, what alternatives were considered, and which rules applied. Readable by compliance officers, not just data scientists. 
| 
                        Temporal Control | 
                        Replay from database snapshots. Hours to reconstruct a scenario. | 
                        Limited replay. Model inference on historical data. | 
                        Full temporal control. Pause any entity. Step forward one decision at a time. Rewind to any point. Launch parallel scenarios to test what-if hypotheses on live state. Inject simulated threats and measure system response. 
| 
                        Spatial Awareness | 
                        None. Transactions are flat records. | 
                        Graph analytics on stored relationships. | 
                        Volumetric spatial perception. Each entity has ambient awareness of risk, activity, and density in its neighbourhood of the entity graph. Entities surrounded by high-risk neighbours behave differently. Emergent intelligence, not just pattern matching. 
| 
                        Scalability | 
                        Add servers. Add databases. Linear cost scaling. | 
                        Add GPU instances for model inference. Separate from core platform. | 
                        Single GPU: 500,000 entities against the 56-policy catalogue in 667 ms, median of three runs. Under 1GB VRAM for the full pipeline. Headroom for larger populations and concurrent federation. 
| 
                        Multi-Industry | 
                        Financial services only. Separate products for each regulation. | 
                        Financial services only. Domain-specific models. | 
                        Industry-agnostic governance engine. Financial crime is the first application. The same engine governs any domain where autonomous entities must operate under verifiable rules. 
| 
                        Privacy | 
                        Data centralisation. Access controls. Pseudonymisation. | 
                        Same as traditional, plus model access controls. | 
                        Multi-party computation under a semi-honest adversary model. No raw or directly identifying customer data leaves the institution. No EU data protection authority has yet ruled on the status of MPC protocol messages; obtaining a formal assessment from a national data protection authority is a stated objective.

## The Numbers



                750K
                complex events/sec across the 500K-entity cycle


                <10ms
                alert lifecycle, ingestion to triage


                667 ms
                500K entities, 56-policy catalogue


                TRL 6

The detection cycle figure is a median of three runs on NVIDIA RTX 5090, CUDA 13.1, Linux, against synthetic data. Every result signed.







The difference between adding AI to compliance software and building compliance on AI is architectural. It cannot be retrofitted. It must be built from the ground up.
